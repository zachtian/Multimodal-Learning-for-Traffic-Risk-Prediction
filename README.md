# Multimodal-Traffic-Risk-Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for the paper **"Multimodal Learning for Traffic Risk Prediction: Combining Aerial Imagery with Contextual Data."** This study introduces a novel deep learning framework to enhance traffic risk prediction by integrating multiple data modalities, including aerial imagery, building footprint data, and traffic flow information.

## Overview

Traditional models for traffic risk prediction often rely on a single data source, such as visual data from aerial images or historical accident records, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of urban environments. Our multimodal framework leverages datasets from OpenStreetMap, UK Traffic Count, and high-resolution aerial imagery to create a comprehensive representation of the urban environment, significantly improving prediction accuracy and localization of high-risk zones.
